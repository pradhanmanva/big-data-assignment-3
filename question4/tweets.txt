But it's even better: A new study finds that Bernie Sanders's bill would save $5.1 trillion — while providing universal, comprehensive coverage. https://t.co/6UJ2HXXDrx --> PositiveI expect @SenSanders to win the primary. He already set the conditions for the race—all of the other hopefuls (except Biden) have endorsed his big platform items.
